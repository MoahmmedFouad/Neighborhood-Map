# Project Overview

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


## Why this Project?

The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.
Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. You’ll then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, you’ll implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.


## How will this help my career?

*Interacting with API servers is the primary function of Front-End Web Developers
*Use of third-party libraries and APIs is a standard and acceptable practice that is encouraged
*Asynchronous programming is important to understand in today's market.

# how to start the application?
